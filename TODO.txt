TODO List
=========

Term Evaluator
	- takes the result of term and converts it to a word or byte value
	  constant or address reference. Add support for references @identifier
	  may involve inline compilation of strings.
	  (issue with strings in banked space - code note about string transcience)

Terms
	- term setting mode and loading accumulators
	- system for dumping and disassembly on exit.

Store
	- store to byte and word and the various issues.

Binary
	- handler for binary ops will be fairly consistent apart from 
	  action when upper byte is constant, zero. When word <bin> byte
	  the upper byte is zero.

Unary
	- inline compilation according to mode.

Inline
	- inline variables, references. 
	
Procedure definitions
	- strip user dictionary of local variables.

Procedure Invocation

Forward /
	- just sets the mode to 8.

Structures
	- repeat
	- if
	- times

Machine Code Libraries
	- simple interface.
