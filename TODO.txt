TODO List
=========

Dispatcher for tokens.
	- scan files looking for token handlers, and build a table to auto dispatch.

Variable Declarations (generalise for parameters and procedure def check)
	- [type] <identifier> may be followed by ( @ or not.
	- ( is a procedure definition which should be stub code.

Check variable find works.
	- globals/locals/byte/word

Term Evaluator
	- takes the result of term and converts it to a word or byte value
	  constant or address reference. Add support for references @identifier
	  may involve inline compilation of strings.
	  (issue with strings in banked space - code note about string transcience)

Terms
	- term setting mode and loading accumulators
	- system for dumping and disassembly on exit.

Store
	- store to byte and word and the various issues.

Binary
	- handler for binary ops will be fairly consistent apart from 
	  action when upper byte is constant, zero. When word <bin> byte
	  the upper byte is zero.

Unary
	- inline compilation according to mode.

Inline
	- inline variables, references.
